For this assignment, I wanted to make an app that allows us to capture a subject throughout time. It allows the user to easily scroll through a timeline of the subject. 
Some plans I had for later upgrades to the app include: 
a. Notifications to remind you to take a photo of the subject every day. 
b. Galleries/folders so the user can capture as many different subjects as they want and keep them organized.
